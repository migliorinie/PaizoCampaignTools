PaizoCampArr
============
This script dynamically arranges the Paizo.com campaign listing seen on a 
user's "campaigns" page, and highlights the new post notification links 
which appear next to threads (i.e. "1 new"). If you want to disable one or 
the other feature, just prepend the relevant lines with "//" (no quotes).

Firefox Installation:

1) Install Greasemonkey. 

2) In Firefox, click Tools -> Greasemonkey -> Manage User Scripts, and drag 
camparr.user.js onto that window. Click "Install". Congratulations!

Opera Installation:

1) Open paizo.com

2) Right-click the page -> Edit Site Preferences. On the Display tab, add 
the path to camparr.css in "My style sheet".

3) In the same Site Preferences window, click on the Scripting tab, then 
under User JavaScript folder add the path to camparr.user.js. Done!

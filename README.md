Paizo Campaign Tools
====================

There are a bunch of tools included in this bundle:

- Alias Selector (lets you define an alias to use as your default posting alias on a per-campaign basis)
- Alias Sorter (lets you sort alias pages and view aliases in a more condensed "data view")
- Arranger (rearranges the user campaigns page to be more readable [with less scrolling])
- Inactive Alias Designation (allows the designation of your own aliases as "inactive", placing them into a separate section)
- User Blacklist (greys out or hides posts by certain users)
- Highlighter (highlights the "(x new)" link on campaign pages)
- Campaign Chat (lets you chat live with other people in the same campaigns)
- Three new message board tags for extended formatting ([u][/u], [color][/color], and [code][/code]).

C'mon now, how hard a decision is that?

For Opera users, the old user scripts are still available, but the User 
Blacklist feature is not included. If anyone's interested in teaming up 
to get a the Blacklist feature written for Opera, let me know!

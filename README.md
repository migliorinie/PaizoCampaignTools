Paizo Campaign Tools
====================

There are five tools included in this bundle: the Alias Selector (lets you 
define an alias to use as your default posting alias on a per-campaign basis),
Arranger (rearranges the user campaigns page to be more readable [with less 
scrolling]), the User Blacklist (greys out or hides posts by certain users), 
Highlighter (highlights the "(x new)" link on campaign pages), and Campaign 
Chat (lets you chat live with other people in the same campaigns).

C'mon now, how hard a decision is that?

For Opera users, the old user scripts are still available, but the User 
Blacklist feature is not included. If anyone's interested in teaming up 
to get a the Blacklist feature written for Opera, let me know!

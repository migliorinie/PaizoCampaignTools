Paizo Campaign Tools
====================

There are three main tools included in this bundle: the Arranger (rearranges 
the user campaigns page to be more readable [with less scrolling]), the User 
Blacklist (greys out posts by certain users), and Highlighter (highlights 
the "(x new)" link on campaign pages). 

For Chrome and Opera users, the old user scripts are still available, but the 
User Blacklist feature is not included. If anyone's interested in teaming up 
to get real extensions written for Chrome and Opera, let me know!

Firefox Installation:

1) Download pct.xpi from the firefox-add-on directory.

2) Open Firefox, and drag pct.xpi from the downloaded location onto the open 
   Firefox window. Click "Install Now". Congratulations!


Opera Installation:

1) Download camparr.css and camparr.user.js from the base directory.

1) Navigate to paizo.com

2) Right-click the page -> Edit Site Preferences. On the Display tab, add 
the path to camparr.css in "My style sheet".

3) In the same Site Preferences window, click on the Scripting tab, then 
under User JavaScript folder add the path to camparr.user.js. Done!


Google Chrome Installation:

Due to some recent changes by Google in how extensions are handled, as far 
as I'm aware you can't install the extension directly. Some workarounds 
have been proposed; you can try the instructions at 
http://userscripts.org/about/installing - they look like they might work.
